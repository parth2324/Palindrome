# Palindrome
Checking whether input number is a palindrome or not, via Palindrome Pair Theory.
Hi,
This Theory is given by me, Parth, according to which palindrome numbers exist in pairs such that :
Pair(n,evenized(n/11));
evenize() : Check out the code ! ex) 121 -> 1221
                                 ex) 12321 -> 123321
The program works on an observed axiom that if any number n is divisible by 11 and evenized (n/11) ia also divisible by 11, 
then n is a palindrome number. 
Mathematical derivation for evenize() attached, and it also explain's the working with a testcase.
