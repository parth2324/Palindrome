Hi,
This Theory is given by me, Parth, according to which plaindrome numbers exist in pairs such that :
Pair(n,evenized(n/11));
evenize() : Check out the code ! ex) 121 -> 1221
                                 ex) 12321 -> 123321
  The program works on an observed axiom that if any number n is divisible by 11 and evenized (n/11) ia also divisible by 11, 
  then n is a palindrome number. 
  Mathematical derivation for evenize() attached.
